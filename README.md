# TP-Machine-Learning-Projects
This repository contains previous projects done by some of the students from Temasek Polytechnic. Previously known as The ML Noobies, all the deployed projects have been linked here for easy management. We hope this will benefit future students and developers. The ML Noobies can be accessed at https://enigmatic-retreat-79157.herokuapp.com/
